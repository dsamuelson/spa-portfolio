## Description

This is my portfolio built using React! Of course this is not my total portfolio, but it is enough to demonstrate my knowledge of React principles and show off some of my work. It can be adjusted to meet the needs of whoever wants to use it. All styling is done in the index.css so if you don't like the simple style I went with feel free to adjust it.

 When you enter the page you are greeted with the "about me" section which has a short description of myself and how I got into web-development. I have made the page mobile-first responsive so feel free to browse from your phone.

 After you choose to go to another page the link you picked will go orange and underlined and the title of the tab will change to whatever the current page is.

 Here is a good example of how it's mobile responsive as you can see everything lines up nicely and when you go to a larger screen size it will grid up.

There is a non-functioning contact page (non-functioning as in it is not attached to a backend database so it won't actually contact anyone, though it could be attached to a database and made functional)

 Then finally there is a page dedicated to my resume which you can download at any time but you get a general idea of my proficiencies.
