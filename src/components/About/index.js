            <p>
                I love web development, and to an extent I think that is the most important thing about me. When you find someone who's passion is in the line of work you are offering that person will be the best asset to your team and company in general. I started programming with visual basic back when I was 12. My father was in computer development long before they were even out for public consumption. He taught me the basics of creating an application for computers at that time and was surprised by my progress 4 days later when I was creating dynamic elements and working with array methods. Life happened and I kind of lost that passion for a while and when I started up again I realized this was indeed my calling. I need to be a developer! It's in my heart and soul to create awesome pages and applications that people can use and enjoy and can benefit the world.

                Apart from this I am also an incredibly hard worker. I grew up on a rural farm in upstate NY and rain or snow cold or heat we were out taking care of the farm and the needs of the animals. I have taken that work ethic into other fields I've worked in. I am always up for a challenge and able to endure alot of problems that come with every field I've devoted myself to.
